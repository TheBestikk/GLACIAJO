# GLACIAJO
## History project
### This project is the second semester project (you wonâ€™t find the first one on this account since it was on the Wordpress CMS system) I completed it in one evening, the rest of the data on the presentation type will probably be attached later thanks for your attention and now about the project there are 3 weeks left until the end of the course and this Saturday (10.26.2024 when you are already a viewer looking at the repository, I have no idea) then they told us about the project, I examined the layout on Figma and began work, connected the fonts then I started importing pictures and renaming them after completing the file structure, naming and other routine, I started marking up in literally 1 hour, I did the markup and made styles in +- 2 hours (all without taking into account edits later for a compact and convenient code)

## [Unrealized]
### At the moment, my mentor has not yet checked the final project, so there are no plans to change anything, as soon as there are changes, I will write it down here
